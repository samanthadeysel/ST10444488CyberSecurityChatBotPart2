The chatbot is designed to help users through interactive conversation about security.

What the Chatbot Does ✅:

The chatbot will introduce itself to the users, then ask the user for their name. After that it will ask the user to ask a question based on certain topics, and will respond with certain points, but if not a question asked, the program will ask for them to repeat, or will ask if the user wants to enter their knowledge for tips based on their knowledge.
The chatbot will also give a random tip when needed or asked for a tip on knowledge. Wont be the same tip over and over.
Because the chatbot can pick up key words, a user can enter sentences and the chatbot will still respond to the main point.
If the chatbot cannot detect anything, it will ask the user for their level of knowledge, and still provide them a randomised tip to help the user.
if the user types 'exit' the conversation ends, gets saved, and the system shuts down.
